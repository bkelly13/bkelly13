- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bkelly13
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in wxwidgets under Windows 11 and Visual Studio 2019.
- I'm also interested in wxwidgets under Fedora.  I am working that installation but not doing well yet.
- Specifically, I would like to see a simple project that is well modularized just to see how someone experienced set things up.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me?  I presume this is a forum like environment and I will check here.
- Else, email b1 at mbkelly dot net

Thank you for your time.
